# Fresh Theme for Mindustry

A modern, minimalist Mindustry skin with a focus on clarity and readability.

Work in progress. Currently, only a few textures are changed (everything else falls back to default Mindustry look).

# Distribution

- Thinner conveyors: makes it easier to see where the belt input is coming from
- Clearly distinguished blocks: unlike the default look, where the sorter & overflow gate basically look the same
- Meaningful features: makes it easy to see & remember what's going on (e.g. junction is a smol bridge)

# Items

- More distinct colors: unlike vanilla, where copper/sand/phase/surge are variations of the same color
- Unique shapes: hopefully easier to distinguish, particularly for colorblind users
